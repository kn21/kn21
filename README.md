## About me 💃
Studied **Applied Physics at University of California, Irvine**. Exploring **data science** and **machine learning**.
Physics = versatility, rigorous problem solving, and a taste for challenge. From art, to writing, to data science, my greatest satisfaction has come from directing projects at inception to the final product.


## Tech Stack 🐸
**Python** (Pandas | Numpy | Scipy | Astropy), C++, Java, Javascript, Wolfram (Mathematica), LaTex
Machine Learning (Scikit Learn | Keras | BERT | NLTK), Data visualization (Matplotlib | Seaborn)


## Featured Project 💡
**CariConnect** with Break Through Tech LA and Caribbean Literary Conference (CARICON)
Ranked recommendation system based on integrated clustering and NLP model. Matches upcoming others with prospective publishers. Input book information gathers similar books from existing dataset and fetches respective publishers, with ranking and generated explanation.

## Mission 🔭
From astronomical readings to natural language processing, my experience with data has evolved, but the central force has remained the same- modeling is how we understand the world, analysis is how we unlock those explanations. However, it was my unique perspective, as an artist and underrepresented person, that I became aware of data’s potential, good and bad. In the world of data, a human with experience knows that an output that represents the majority is not truly representative, and accounts for fair representation- a human without relevant experience would never think to consider it, and nor would their machine. When those in charge of manipulating the data do not have the experiences to consider all of the potential pitfalls or shortcomings of their stratagem, ethical issues are bound to arise. That is why it is important that the data scientists themselves be representative of the world and its experiences.
