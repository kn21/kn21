## About me 💃
**Applied Physics at University of California, Irvine**. Exploring **data science** and **machine learning**.<br />
Physics = versatility, rigorous problem solving, and a taste for challenge. From art, to writing, to data science, my greatest satisfaction has come from directing projects at inception to the final product.


## Tech Stack 🐸
**Python** (Pandas | Numpy | Scipy | Astropy), C++, Java, Javascript, Wolfram (Mathematica), LaTex<br />
Machine Learning (Scikit Learn | Keras | BERT | NLTK), Data visualization (Matplotlib | Seaborn)


## Featured Project 💡
**CariConnect** with Break Through Tech LA and Caribbean Literary Conference (CARICON), 3 mo.<br />
Ranked recommendation system based on integrated clustering and LLM models. Matches upcoming authors with prospective publishers using input book information by gathering similar books from existing dataset through clustering and cosine similarity, while the LLM provides re-ranking and a generated explanation. <br />
